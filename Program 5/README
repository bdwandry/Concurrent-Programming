Note*** This program is not fully functional, I've tried building out the logic as much as possible. But I was unable to get the monitors to
mesh together correctly. This program will run for a little bit, but it will eventually dead-lock and you will need to kill it by 'ctrl + c'.

1. Question: How do you guarantee that only three elves will ask questions?
		In my program, I try to guarantee that only three elves are allowed to ask questions at a time because of there is an array of elves that
		gets added to accordingly. Once the array of elves are full, they can attempt/wait to ask santa a question. Then they're returned and the
		array is overwritten. 

2. Question: Show that why no elf will leave before the questions are answered.
		Elves array: [ [1], [2], [3] ] is full.
		if (elves is full) then
			attempt to ask question/wake up santa.
		...
		question answered
		then elves leave the array.


3. Question: Show that while three elves are waiting for an answer, no other elves can cut in and ask questions.
		Elves array: [ [1], [2], [3] ] is full.
		elves are forced to wait by condition
		if (elves is full) then
			attempt to ask question/wake up santa.
		...
		question answered
		then elves leave the array.
		elves are released from condition

4. Question: How do you guarantee that Santa only answers question while he is not sleeping.
		This is done by a wake up condition, while he is sleeping, the condition hold. 
		He will wake up once the pre-conditions are met. 

5. Question: Show that when Santa is wakened up by a reindeer, this reindeer is the last one coming back from vacation.
		...
		Santa is preparing sleighs.
				Elf 1 has a problem
				Elf 3 has a problem
			The last reindeer 4 wakes up Santa.
		The team flies off (1)!
		...

6. Question: How do you make sure that Santa always handles reindeers first.
		In the santa thread, it is always checkong reindeer first before elves. Plus several steps are in place to make sure
		that all reindeer are handled with priority. Well suppose to be.

7. Question: Show that while Santa is attaching the sleigh and delivering toys, all reindeers are there. They won't sneak out for vacation.
		I cannot guarantee this in the failed program.

8. Question: Show that while Santa is attaching the sleigh and delivering toys, elves will not ask questions.
		In the santa thread, it is always checkong reindeer. Plus several steps are in place to make sure
		that all reindeer are handled with priority. Well suppose to be.
